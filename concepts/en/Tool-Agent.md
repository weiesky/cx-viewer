# Agent

## Definition

Launches a SubAgent to autonomously handle complex multi-step tasks. SubAgents are independent subprocesses, each with their own dedicated tool set and context. Agent is the renamed version of the Task tool in newer Claude Code releases.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `prompt` | string | Yes | Description of the task for the SubAgent to execute |
| `description` | string | Yes | A 3-5 word short summary |
| `subagent_type` | string | Yes | SubAgent type, determines the available tool set |
| `model` | enum | No | Specify model (sonnet / opus / haiku), defaults to inheriting from parent |
| `max_turns` | integer | No | Maximum number of agentic turns |
| `run_in_background` | boolean | No | Whether to run in the background; background tasks return an output_file path |
| `resume` | string | No | Agent ID to resume, continues from the last execution. Useful for picking up where a previous SubAgent left off without losing context |
| `isolation` | enum | No | Isolation mode, `worktree` creates a temporary git worktree |

## SubAgent Types

| Type | Purpose | Available Tools |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| `Bash` | Command execution, git operations | Bash |
| `general-purpose` | General multi-step tasks | All tools |
| `Explore` | Quick codebase exploration | All tools except Agent/Edit/Write/NotebookEdit/ExitPlanMode |
| `Plan` | Design implementation plans | All tools except Agent/Edit/Write/NotebookEdit/ExitPlanMode |
| `claude-code-guide` | Claude Code usage guide Q&A | Glob, Grep, Read, WebFetch, WebSearch |
| `statusline-setup` | Configure status bar | Read, Edit |

## Use Cases

**Good for:**
- Complex tasks requiring multi-step autonomous completion
- Codebase exploration and deep research (using Explore type)
- Parallel work requiring isolated environments
- Long-running tasks that need to run in the background

**Not good for:**
- Reading a specific file path — use Read or Glob directly
- Searching within 2-3 known files — use Read directly
- Searching for a specific class definition — use Glob directly

## Notes

- After completion, the SubAgent returns a single message; its results are not visible to the user and need to be relayed by the main agent
- Multiple Agent calls can be issued in parallel within a single message for efficiency
- Background tasks are checked for progress via the TaskOutput tool
- The Explore type is slower than directly calling Glob/Grep; only use it when simple searches are insufficient
- Use `run_in_background: true` for long-running tasks that don't need immediate results; use foreground (default) when the main agent needs the result before proceeding
- The `resume` parameter allows continuing a previously started SubAgent session, preserving its accumulated context

## Original Text

<textarea readonly>Launch a new agent to handle complex, multi-step tasks autonomously.

The Agent tool launches specialized agents (subprocesses) that autonomously handle complex tasks. Each agent type has specific capabilities and tools available to it.

Available agent types and the tools they have access to:
- general-purpose: General-purpose agent for researching complex questions, searching for code, and executing multi-step tasks. When you are searching for a keyword or file and are not confident that you will find the right match in the first few tries use this agent to perform the search for you. (Tools: *)
- statusline-setup: Use this agent to configure the user's Claude Code status line setting. (Tools: Read, Edit)
- Explore: Fast agent specialized for exploring codebases. Use this when you need to quickly find files by patterns (eg. "src/components/**/*.tsx"), search code for keywords (eg. "API endpoints"), or answer questions about the codebase (eg. "how do API endpoints work?"). When calling this agent, specify the desired thoroughness level: "quick" for basic searches, "medium" for moderate exploration, or "very thorough" for comprehensive analysis across multiple locations and naming conventions. (Tools: All tools except Agent, ExitPlanMode, Edit, Write, NotebookEdit)
- Plan: Software architect agent for designing implementation plans. Use this when you need to plan the implementation strategy for a task. Returns step-by-step plans, identifies critical files, and considers architectural trade-offs. (Tools: All tools except Agent, ExitPlanMode, Edit, Write, NotebookEdit)
- claude-code-guide: Use this agent when the user asks questions ("Can Claude...", "Does Claude...", "How do I...") about: (1) Claude Code (the CLI tool) - features, hooks, slash commands, MCP servers, settings, IDE integrations, keyboard shortcuts; (2) Claude Agent SDK - building custom agents; (3) Claude API (formerly Anthropic API) - API usage, tool use, Anthropic SDK usage. **IMPORTANT:** Before spawning a new agent, check if there is already a running or recently completed claude-code-guide agent that you can resume using the "resume" parameter. (Tools: Glob, Grep, Read, WebFetch, WebSearch)

When using the Agent tool, you must specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use.

When NOT to use the Agent tool:
- If you want to read a specific file path, use the Read or Glob tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly
- If you are searching for a specific class definition like "class Foo", use the Glob tool instead, to find the match more quickly
- If you are searching for code within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the Read tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly
- Other tasks that are not related to the agent descriptions above

Usage notes:
- Always include a short description (3-5 words) summarizing what the agent will do
- Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses
- When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.
- You can optionally run agents in the background using the run_in_background parameter. When an agent runs in the background, you will be automatically notified when it completes — do NOT sleep, poll, or proactively check on its progress. Continue with other work or respond to the user instead.
- **Foreground vs background**: Use foreground (default) when you need the agent's results before you can proceed — e.g., research agents whose findings inform your next steps. Use background when you have genuinely independent work to do in parallel.
- Agents can be resumed using the `resume` parameter by passing the agent ID from a previous invocation. When resumed, the agent continues with its full previous context preserved. When NOT resuming, each invocation starts fresh and you should provide a detailed task description with all necessary context.
- When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you along with its agent ID. You can use this ID to resume the agent later if needed for follow-up work.
- Provide clear, detailed prompts so the agent can work autonomously and return exactly the information you need.
- Agents with "access to current context" can see the full conversation history before the tool call. When using these agents, you can write concise prompts that reference earlier context (e.g., "investigate the error discussed above") instead of repeating information. The agent will receive all prior messages and understand the context.
- The agent's outputs should generally be trusted
- Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user's intent
- If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.
- If the user specifies that they want you to run agents "in parallel", you MUST send a single message with multiple Agent tool use content blocks. For example, if you need to launch both a build-validator agent and a test-runner agent in parallel, send a single message with both tool calls.
- You can optionally set `isolation: "worktree"` to run the agent in a temporary git worktree, giving it an isolated copy of the repository. The worktree is automatically cleaned up if the agent makes no changes; if changes are made, the worktree path and branch are returned in the result.

Example usage:

<example_agent_descriptions>
"test-runner": use this agent after you are done writing code to run tests
"greeting-responder": use this agent to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke
</example_agent_descriptions>

<example>
user: "Please write a function that checks if a number is prime"
assistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime
assistant: First let me use the Write tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime
assistant: I'm going to use the Write tool to write the following code:
<code>
function isPrime(n) {
  if (n <= 1) return false
  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {
    if (n % i === 0) return false
  }
  return true
}
</code>
<commentary>
Since a significant piece of code was written and the task was completed, now use the test-runner agent to run the tests
</commentary>
assistant: Now let me use the test-runner agent to run the tests
assistant: Uses the Agent tool to launch the test-runner agent
</example>

<example>
user: "Hello"
<commentary>
Since the user is greeting, use the greeting-responder agent to respond with a friendly joke
</commentary>
assistant: "I'm going to use the Agent tool to launch the greeting-responder agent"
</example>
</textarea>
