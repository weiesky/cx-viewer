# Agent

## 定義

啟動一個子 agent（SubAgent）來自主處理複雜的多步驟任務。子 agent 是獨立的子程序，擁有各自專用的工具集和上下文。Agent 是新版 Codex 中 Task 工具的重新命名版本。

## 參數

| 參數 | 類型 | 必填 | 說明 |
|------|------|------|------|
| `prompt` | string | 是 | 子 agent 要執行的任務描述 |
| `description` | string | 是 | 3-5 個詞的簡短摘要 |
| `subagent_type` | string | 是 | 子 agent 類型，決定可用工具集 |
| `model` | enum | 否 | 指定模型（sonnet / opus / haiku），預設繼承父級 |
| `max_turns` | integer | 否 | 最大 agentic 輪次數 |
| `run_in_background` | boolean | 否 | 是否背景執行，背景任務回傳 output_file 路徑 |
| `resume` | string | 否 | 要恢復的 agent ID，從上次執行繼續。適用於在不遺失上下文的情況下接續之前的子 agent |
| `isolation` | enum | 否 | 隔離模式，`worktree` 建立臨時 git worktree |

## 子 agent 類型

| 類型 | 用途 | 可用工具 |
|------|------|----------|
| `Bash` | 命令執行，git 操作 | Bash |
| `general-purpose` | 通用多步驟任務 | 全部工具 |
| `Explore` | 快速探索程式碼庫 | 除 Agent/Edit/Write/NotebookEdit/ExitPlanMode 外的所有工具 |
| `Plan` | 設計實施方案 | 除 Agent/Edit/Write/NotebookEdit/ExitPlanMode 外的所有工具 |
| `claude-code-guide` | Codex 使用指南問答 | Glob, Grep, Read, WebFetch, WebSearch |
| `statusline-setup` | 設定狀態列 | Read, Edit |

## 使用場景

**適合使用：**
- 需要多步驟自主完成的複雜任務
- 程式碼庫探索和深度研究（使用 Explore 類型）
- 需要隔離環境的並行工作
- 需要背景執行的長時間任務

**不適合使用：**
- 讀取特定檔案路徑——直接用 Read 或 Glob
- 在 2-3 個已知檔案中搜尋——直接用 Read
- 搜尋特定類別定義——直接用 Glob

## 注意事項

- 子 agent 完成後回傳單條訊息，其結果對使用者不可見，需要主 agent 轉述
- 可以在單條訊息中發起多個並行 Agent 呼叫以提高效率
- 背景任務透過 TaskOutput 工具檢查進度
- Explore 類型比直接呼叫 Glob/Grep 慢，僅在簡單搜尋不夠時使用
- 長時間執行且不需要立即結果的任務建議使用 `run_in_background: true`；需要結果後才能繼續時使用前台模式（預設）
- `resume` 參數允許繼續之前啟動的子 agent 會話，保留其累積的上下文

## 原文

<textarea readonly>Launch a new agent to handle complex, multi-step tasks autonomously.

The Agent tool launches specialized agents (subprocesses) that autonomously handle complex tasks. Each agent type has specific capabilities and tools available to it.

Available agent types and the tools they have access to:
- general-purpose: General-purpose agent for researching complex questions, searching for code, and executing multi-step tasks. When you are searching for a keyword or file and are not confident that you will find the right match in the first few tries use this agent to perform the search for you. (Tools: *)
- statusline-setup: Use this agent to configure the user's Codex status line setting. (Tools: Read, Edit)
- Explore: Fast agent specialized for exploring codebases. Use this when you need to quickly find files by patterns (eg. "src/components/**/*.tsx"), search code for keywords (eg. "API endpoints"), or answer questions about the codebase (eg. "how do API endpoints work?"). When calling this agent, specify the desired thoroughness level: "quick" for basic searches, "medium" for moderate exploration, or "very thorough" for comprehensive analysis across multiple locations and naming conventions. (Tools: All tools except Agent, ExitPlanMode, Edit, Write, NotebookEdit)
- Plan: Software architect agent for designing implementation plans. Use this when you need to plan the implementation strategy for a task. Returns step-by-step plans, identifies critical files, and considers architectural trade-offs. (Tools: All tools except Agent, ExitPlanMode, Edit, Write, NotebookEdit)
- claude-code-guide: Use this agent when the user asks questions ("Can Claude...", "Does Claude...", "How do I...") about: (1) Codex (the CLI tool) - features, hooks, slash commands, MCP servers, settings, IDE integrations, keyboard shortcuts; (2) Claude Agent SDK - building custom agents; (3) Claude API (formerly Anthropic API) - API usage, tool use, Anthropic SDK usage. **IMPORTANT:** Before spawning a new agent, check if there is already a running or recently completed claude-code-guide agent that you can resume using the "resume" parameter. (Tools: Glob, Grep, Read, WebFetch, WebSearch)

When using the Agent tool, you must specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use.

When NOT to use the Agent tool:
- If you want to read a specific file path, use the Read or Glob tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly
- If you are searching for a specific class definition like "class Foo", use the Glob tool instead, to find the match more quickly
- If you are searching for code within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the Read tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly
- Other tasks that are not related to the agent descriptions above

Usage notes:
- Always include a short description (3-5 words) summarizing what the agent will do
- Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses
- When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.
- You can optionally run agents in the background using the run_in_background parameter. When an agent runs in the background, you will be automatically notified when it completes — do NOT sleep, poll, or proactively check on its progress. Continue with other work or respond to the user instead.
- **Foreground vs background**: Use foreground (default) when you need the agent's results before you can proceed — e.g., research agents whose findings inform your next steps. Use background when you have genuinely independent work to do in parallel.
- Agents can be resumed using the `resume` parameter by passing the agent ID from a previous invocation. When resumed, the agent continues with its full previous context preserved. When NOT resuming, each invocation starts fresh and you should provide a detailed task description with all necessary context.
- When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you along with its agent ID. You can use this ID to resume the agent later if needed for follow-up work.
- Provide clear, detailed prompts so the agent can work autonomously and return exactly the information you need.
- Agents with "access to current context" can see the full conversation history before the tool call. When using these agents, you can write concise prompts that reference earlier context (e.g., "investigate the error discussed above") instead of repeating information. The agent will receive all prior messages and understand the context.
- The agent's outputs should generally be trusted
- Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user's intent
- If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.
- If the user specifies that they want you to run agents "in parallel", you MUST send a single message with multiple Agent tool use content blocks. For example, if you need to launch both a build-validator agent and a test-runner agent in parallel, send a single message with both tool calls.
- You can optionally set `isolation: "worktree"` to run the agent in a temporary git worktree, giving it an isolated copy of the repository. The worktree is automatically cleaned up if the agent makes no changes; if changes are made, the worktree path and branch are returned in the result.

Example usage:

<example_agent_descriptions>
"test-runner": use this agent after you are done writing code to run tests
"greeting-responder": use this agent to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke
</example_agent_descriptions>

<example>
user: "Please write a function that checks if a number is prime"
assistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime
assistant: First let me use the Write tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime
assistant: I'm going to use the Write tool to write the following code:
<code>
function isPrime(n) {
  if (n <= 1) return false
  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {
    if (n % i === 0) return false
  }
  return true
}
</code>
<commentary>
Since a significant piece of code was written and the task was completed, now use the test-runner agent to run the tests
</commentary>
assistant: Now let me use the test-runner agent to run the tests
assistant: Uses the Agent tool to launch the test-runner agent
</example>

<example>
user: "Hello"
<commentary>
Since the user is greeting, use the greeting-responder agent to respond with a friendly joke
</commentary>
assistant: "I'm going to use the Agent tool to launch the greeting-responder agent"
</example>
</textarea>
