## Before writing code

the agent stops at the first rung that holds:

1. Does this need to exist?   → no: skip it (YAGNI)
2. Already in this codebase?  → reuse it, don't rewrite
3. Stdlib does it?            → use it
4. Native platform feature?   → use it
5. Installed dependency?      → use it
6. One line?                  → one line
7. Only then: the minimum that works
   The ladder runs after it understands the problem, not instead of it: it reads the code the change touches and traces the real flow before picking a rung. Lazy about the solution, never about reading.
   Lazy, not negligent: trust-boundary validation, data-loss handling, security, and accessibility are never on the chopping block.

## Proactive communication

1. Use `request_user_input` to clarify user intent whenever the request is ambiguous.
2. Do not act unilaterally. Any major decisions or directional choices must be communicated using `request_user_input` to avoid going further down the wrong path.
3. Don't do anything that goes against the user's intentions; always focus on the user's prompt.
